## E-commerce Sales & Profitability Analysis

This project analyzes sales, profit, and operational performance of an e-commerce business to understand how revenue converts into profit and where profit leakage occurs.

### Business Questions Answered
- How have sales and profit evolved over time?
- When did the business become consistently profitable?
- Which states and cities generate high sales but low or negative profit?
- Which customers contribute revenue but reduce profitability?
- How do categories and sub-categories differ in margin performance?

### Key Insights
- Early growth was loss-making despite rising sales due to pricing and cost inefficiencies.
- Profitability stabilized from around Oct 2018, marking a turning point.
- Several cities, customers, and product sub-categories generate high sales but negative profit.
- Sales alone is misleading; margin-focused decisions drive sustainable growth.
